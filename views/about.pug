            | I'm already working as a DEV currently but I was only doing the backend part and didn't really know that much about JavaScript and the frontend part in general.
            | So I thought, what the heck, I like learning and this tech degree seemed like a good fit. 
            | And I have to say, I really like it and love learning all these new things. So if you're looking for a motivated and engaged dev, I'm your guy!
